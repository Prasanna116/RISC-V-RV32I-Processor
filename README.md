# RISC-V-RV32I-Processor
The main motive of the project is to understand the RISC-V ISA and it's architecture.  A RTL design of 3-staged pipeline architecture of the RV32I is carried out and The validation phase involves rigorous testing through systematically constructed test benches provided in the UVM, with simulation results presented for scrutiny.
